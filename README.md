Educational Demo – SAFE skrivefelt (UI clone)

This project is a personal, educational demo created to practice front-end development and UI replication.

What this is ✅

A look-alike / UI clone inspired by Aalborg Katedralskole’s “Lukket skrivefelt (SAFE)” page.

Built only for learning purposes (HTML/CSS/JS, form layout, autosave UI, accessibility, etc.).

Hosted separately on Netlify with my own domain.

What this is NOT ❌

- Not the official school tool

- Not affiliated with Aalborg Katedralskole

- Not a replacement for the real exam/assignment platform

- Not intended to help anyone bypass restrictions in school systems

Important disclaimer:

All branding, names, and design elements that resemble the school’s system are used solely for educational demonstration and remain the property of their respective owners.

This demo should not be used for real exams, graded assignments, or official submissions unless a teacher/school explicitly allows it.

If the school requests changes (e.g., remove branding or take the site down), I will comply.

Differences from the official tool

This demo may include features that are not enabled in the official version (for example autocorrect or copy/paste) because the goal is to experiment with browser behavior and usability.
These differences are for learning only and are not meant to circumvent school rules.
